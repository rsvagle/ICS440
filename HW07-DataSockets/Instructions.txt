Data Sockets Lab
================
1. Edit SocketClient adding code at the points marked with TODO.
2. Edit SocketServer adding code at the points marked with TODO.
3. Run DataSocketsTest to validate your code.
4. In Windows Explorer, double-click the DataSocketsLab_Demo.jar file
   to see how the output should look (your does not have to be an exact 
   match, but it does have to pass all the tests). When running the
   demo, you will *not* be able to simultaneously run *your* server as they
   both try to use the same port (close the demo to run your server).
5. Using RequestResponseMapping is optional. If you don't use it, look
   at the source to see the appropriate responses for various requests.
6. When the request of "GOODBYE" is sent up by the client and after the
   server responds with "BYE-BYE", the streams and Socket should be closed.
7. Use the writeUTF(String s) method on DataOutputStream to send a reqeust
   (or a response) over the OutputStream of the Socket.
8. Use the readUTF() method on DataInputStream to receive a request (or a
   response) from the InputStream of the Socket.
