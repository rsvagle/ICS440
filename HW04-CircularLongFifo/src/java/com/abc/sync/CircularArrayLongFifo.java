/**
 * Implementation of {@link LongFifo} which uses a circular array internally.
 * <p>
 * Look at the documentation in LongFifo to see how the methods are supposed to
 * work.
 * <p>
 * The data is stored in the slots array. count is the number of items currently
 * in the FIFO. When the FIFO is not empty, head is the index of the next item
 * to remove. When the FIFO is not full, tail is the index of the next available
 * slot to use for an added item. Both head and tail need to jump to index 0
 * when they "increment" past the last valid index of slots (this is what makes
 * it circular).
 * <p>
 * See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">Circular Buffer
 * on Wikipedia</a> for more information.
